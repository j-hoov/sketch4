##### Idea #1

The goal of this piece is to create a pointilist expanded version of an image. The idea is to fill an array with the pixels of an image, use this to create an array of ellipses of random size with the RGB values of the pixel at the center, and then to move the ellipses outward from the center of the object to create an expanded image. In actually coding this piece, I might dispense with the pix array/class, since it might not be necessary. It would also be interesting to play with directionality of the ellipse movement - perhaps they can move radially outward from a mouse click. Feasibility of this piece is TBD, but this is my first idea for a sketch with algorithmic design.
